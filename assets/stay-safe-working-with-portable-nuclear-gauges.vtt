00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.100
Stay safe working with portable nuclear gauges

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.680
Portable nuclear gauges have sources that
emit radiation.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.600
To work safely with these gauges, here’s
what you need to know.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.140
Preparing and using Portable Nuclear Gauges

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.910
Before you start anything, be sure to attach
the dosimeter your employer provided

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.370
somewhere between your neck and waist.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.030
If you do not have a dosimeter, you must log
every shot, even practice shots.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.329
If you are approaching 650 shots in a year,
bring it up with your radiation safety officer.

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.210
When using the gauge, don’t hover over it
or point it at others while the source is

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.220
exposed.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.380
Wait until the gauge is set over the hole
before extending the source rod.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.630
Keep your co-workers and anyone else in the
area at least two meters away from the gauge.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.280
Once it’s set, move away from the gauge.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:28.110
Once it’s done, retract the source rod from
the ground, and then move the portable gauge.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.110
Gauges must always be under direct supervision,
so if you’re going to lunch or taking a

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:40.800
break the gauge has to be locked safely 
and securely.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.031
First, make sure you have the right shipping
documents with you before traveling with a

00:01:53.031 --> 00:01:57.159
gauge to or from the job site.

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.140
Documents must always be within arm’s reach.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.960
Second, when packing the gauge for transport,
make sure the shutter is fully closed to protect

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.579
yourself and the public.

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:12.040
The best practice to check a shutter is with
a radiation survey meter.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.330
A mirror check is a secondary option for checking
the shutter.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.820
Also check that the gauge and transport case
are not damaged.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.470
Once it is in its type A package make sure
the following labels and markings are present

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.970
and legible:

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.660
- Two properly completed category Yellow-II
labels on opposite sides of the package

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.270
- The UN number and proper shipping name next
to each category label

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.079
- Consignor ID
- Name of package manufacturer and VRI code

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.100
At the end of the day, make sure the gauge
is safely and securely stored.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:01.660
If the gauge is damaged, lost, stolen or involved
in a transport accident follow your company’s

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.010
emergency response procedures and inform the
appropriate persons immediately.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:18.970
If you can’t reach your RSO call the CNSC
duty officer immediately at 1-844-879-0805

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:25.700
Following these simple steps will help keep
you and others safe when using portable nuclear gauges

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:38.200
